## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### Multi-Model Configuration
```json
{
  "models": {
    "default": "deepseek",
    "multiModel": {
      "enabled": true,
      "primary": "deepseek",
      "fallback": ["zhipu", "qwen"],
      "loadBalancing": true,
      "costOptimization": true
    },
    "apiKeys": {
      "deepseek": "sk-your-key",
      "zhipu": "your-zhipu-key",
      "qwen": "your-qwen-key",
      "spark": "your-spark-key",
      "moonshot": "your-moonshot-key",
      "baidu": "your-baidu-key"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# New model API keys
QWEN_API_KEY=your-qwen-key
SPARK_API_KEY=your-spark-key
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your-moonshot-key

# Multi-model settings
TASKFLOW_MULTI_MODEL=true
TASKFLOW_PRIMARY_MODEL=deepseek

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Model Setup
```bash
# Configure multiple models
taskflow-ai config set models.apiKeys.deepseek "your-key"
taskflow-ai config set models.apiKeys.zhipu "your-key"
taskflow-ai config set models.apiKeys.qwen "your-key"

# Enable multi-model orchestration
taskflow-ai config set models.multiModel.enabled true
taskflow-ai config set models.multiModel.primary "deepseek"
taskflow-ai config set models.multiModel.fallback "zhipu,qwen"
```

### Advanced Orchestration
